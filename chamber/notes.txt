problems I overcame with home page

when adding css with picture and srcset, I added css to picture, but had a previous
img css that was overriding the size.  I had to add an idenifier to previous img css.

when trying to get the article with the temple title positioned, I had created the article
next to the hero div, not inside as a child, so the next positioned ancestor was the main page

when the image was overflowing the container.  I found that I was trying
to add css to the child picture element, and it didn't affect it.  When I moved
the css to the .hero img, then the css contained the image within the .hero container
